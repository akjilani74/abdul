# 8.Setup Tomcat User Accounts	
        Finally we need to create user accounts to secure and access admin/manager pages. Edit conf/tomcat-users.xml file in your editor and paste inside <tomcat-users> </tomcat-users> tags.
        
        <!-- user manager can access only manager section -->
        <role rolename="manager-gui" />
        <user username="manager" password="_SECRET_PASSWORD_" roles="manager-gui" />

        <!-- user admin can access manager and admin section both -->
        <role rolename="admin-gui" />
        <user username="admin" password="_SECRET_PASSWORD_" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui" />		
# 9. Enable Host/Manager for Remote IP
        
        The default manager and host-manager web pages are enabled to access from localhost only. To access these pages from the remote system, you have to allow your IP or IP range in the application-specific context.xml file.
        
        Manager File: ./webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
        Host Manager File: ./webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml	
        		
		Edit above files and add your IP address
        
        After making changes restart Tomcat service.

# 10.Starting Tomcat Service
        
        Tomcat is very easy to use, There is no need to compile its source. You simply extract the archive and start the tomcat server. Tomcat by default start on port 8080, So make sure no other application using the same port.


        cd /usr/local/apache-tomcat9
        chmod +x ./bin/startup.sh
        ./bin/startup.sh

#11.The following output will be generated
        
        Using CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/local/apache-tomcat9
        Using CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/local/apache-tomcat9
        Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/local/apache-tomcat9/temp
        Using JRE_HOME:        /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-oracle
        Using CLASSPATH:       /usr/local/apache-tomcat9/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/local/apache-tomcat9/bin/tomcat-juli.jar
        Tomcat started.
